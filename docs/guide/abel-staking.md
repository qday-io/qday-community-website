# ABEL Staking User Guide

Before you begin staking, please ensure you have the following:

- An EVM-compatible wallet (MetaMask recommended)
- ABEL tokens in your Abelian Pro wallet
- A small amount of QDAY for transaction fees on QDay network

:::tip Tip
If you don't have a MetaMask wallet yet, please refer to the [MetaMask Wallet User Guide](/guide/metamask).

## What Is the Purpose of ABEL Staking?

ABEL Staking allows you to stake ABEL tokens and earn QDAY tokens every day. It is one of the core features of the QDay ecosystem, designed for long-term supporters of the post-quantum Abelian network.

By converting ABEL into its wrapped form, **WABEL**, you can stake WABEL for a period of your choice—ranging from **3 months to 4 years**. The longer the staking period, the more QDAY tokens you earn each day.

This system transforms passive ABEL holdings into an active, yield-generating asset, aligning user incentives with ecosystem growth.

## How It Works

To participate in ABEL Staking, follow these three simple steps:

1. **Convert ABEL → WABEL**:

   Visit [portal.qday.io](http://portal.qday.io) and use the official Abelian Chain Bridge to convert ABEL tokens on the Abelian network into wrapped ABEL tokens (WABEL) on the QDay network.

2. **Stake WABEL and Receive cvxQDAY**:

   Choose how long you want to lock your WABEL tokens (minimum: 3 months). Immediately after staking, you will receive cvxQDAY tokens, which serve as your staking receipt and reward credential.

3. **Earn QDAY**:

   As long as you hold cvxQDAY, you will receive daily QDAY airdrops. Once your lock-up period ends, you can return your cvxQDAY to unstake your WABEL. You may then optionally convert WABEL back to ABEL via the Abelian Chain Bridge.

## Tutorial

Follow these steps to start staking:

### Step 1: Convert ABEL to WABEL

- Go to the QDay Portfolio: <https://portal.qday.io/>

- Click on the **Bridge** page.

- Switch your wallet to QDay Mainnet.

- Return to the Abelian Chain Bridge.

- Select **"Abelian"** in the **"From"** section (the **"To"** section will automatically switch to **"QDay"**). Manually enter the amount of ABEL and your QDay receiving address (which will also be your WABEL receiving address).

- Click **"Generate QR Code"**.

### Step 2: Stake WABEL

- Go to the **ABEL Staking** page and connect your wallet if you haven't already.

- Enter the amount of WABEL to stake, choose your lock period, and click **"Stake WABEL"**.

### Step 3: Earn Daily QDAY

After confirmation, cvxQDAY and WQDAY will appear in your wallet.

:::tip Important
Think of cvxQDAY as both a **"staking receipt"** and a **"reward credential"**. You earn rewards every day as long as you hold cvxQDAY tokens.

### Step 4: Unstake After Expiry

- Once your lock-up period ends, go to the **"Unstake"** tab.

- Enter the WABEL amount and click **"Unstake WABEL"**. The system will revoke your cvxQDAY and return your WABEL.

- *(Optional)* Return to the Abelian Chain Bridge to convert WABEL back to ABEL.

## Reward Details

**Maximize Your Crypto Rewards!**

ABEL Staking offers different reward rates based on your lock-up duration—with annualized rates reaching up to **1500%**. Rewards are distributed daily.


Here's how much you can earn based on your lock-up period:

| **Lock-up Period** | **Days Range** | **Multiplier** |
| ------------------ | -------------- | -------------- |
| 3 months           | 90–179 days    | 40%            |
| 6 months           | 180–364 days   | 100%           |
| 12 months          | 365–729 days   | 250%           |
| 24 months          | 730–1094 days  | 600%           |
| 36 months          | 1095–1459 days | 1000%          |
| **48 months**      | **1460 days**  | **1500%**      |

Lock up longer, earn significantly more—and get paid daily. It's that simple!

## Why "cvxQDAY"?

The prefix **"cvx"** stands for `convex`, reflecting the non-linear reward curve: longer lock-ups yield disproportionately higher returns—a common design in advanced DeFi protocols. Paired with "QDAY," it signals both the mechanism and the ecosystem.
