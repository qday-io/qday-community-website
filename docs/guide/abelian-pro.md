## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can ABEL wallet be imported into MetaMask?**

A: No. ABEL uses quantum-secure cryptographic algorithms that are incompatible with the EVM standard used by MetaMask. Only QDay wallets can export private keys and be imported into MetaMask.

**Q: Which wallet type should I use?**

A:
- For daily transactions and frequent use: Pseudo-Private wallet is recommended
- For large asset storage or extremely high privacy needs: Fully-Private wallet is recommended
- Legacy wallets are no longer recommended; please migrate existing wallets to new MLP wallets

**Q: What if I forget my wallet password?**

A: If you have a mnemonic phrase or private key backup, you can delete and reinstall the app, then import the wallet using the mnemonic phrase or private key and set a new password. Without a backup, wallet recovery is impossible.

**Q: What if a transaction keeps showing as pending?**

A:
- ABEL transactions: Check network sync status and wait for more block confirmations
- QDay transactions: May be due to gas fees set too low; you can try to accelerate the transaction or wait for automatic confirmation when the network is less congested
