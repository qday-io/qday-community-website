- After a successful signature, the Account1 account in MetaMask will receive 100 QDAY test tokens, you can claim up to 10 times, totaling 1000 QDAY test tokens.

  (This balance is the result of receiving it twice.)

## Community Application for QDAY Test Tokens

Please join the official pqAbelian [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/Rrb33mC3Kc) and submit a ticket to apply for QDAY tokens.

- In the left sidebar menu, find “||SUPPORT||” at the bottom, click the + sign next to it, expand the submenu, and click “Support-Ticket” to create a ticket.
  ![Create Support Ticket](/qday-testnet/qday-faucet/discord-create-ticket.png)<br>
- The first line should be: `QDAY Testnet Faucet`;
- In the following content, describe the purpose of your QDAY test token application. The more detailed your description, the easier it will be to get approved, especially for large amounts of test tokens;
- Finally, leave your MetaMask wallet address for the QDay Testnet (to receive QDAY test tokens).

Based on the previous example of creating a MetaMask wallet account, the default address for applying for QDAY is the “Account1” address. After receiving QDAY test tokens, it will look like this:
